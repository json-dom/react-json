# react-json

**react-json stands for _structure_, _short_ & _simple_.**

This aims to be a light-weight, minimal and community-driven project to achieve the goal of giving the developers an opportunity to leverage the most of react.js potential by providing web developers tools to write webapps using _json_ structural patters instead of _xml_. This enables developers to use non-relational databases and json-oriented apis to build the next _state-of-art_ web.

- At some point there will be translations and integrations for other _backend-capable_ web languages such as python, php, ruby... and others.

## Why _this should remain evergreen_

- In _near_ future, ready-to-consume components may be more easy to integrate by being directly requested and fetched via json-based apis or be transmitted and retrieved with the help of body requests or url params, using json instead of xml.
- This is possible due to the capability of serving data-bound components already attached to they corresponding render structure.
- This enable developers to add new features to apps in a more _fast_ and _deploy-ready_ way.

## Prerequisites

Must have installed

- node
- npm

You can download these [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

Must known syntaxes:

- html
- css
- javascript

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) can help you learning _html_, _css_ and _javascript_ with a clean and easy-to-read documentation.

[ReactJS](https://react.dev/) even if _not strictly_ necessary, can be very worth to learn due to its ecossystem and state-management.

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is also a great learning source for indeep web development material although i highly recommend using _w3schools_ first for fast references.
